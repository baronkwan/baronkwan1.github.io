### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

CSS padding, borders and margin are things that looks easy but hard to get it right. Fixing that in the way you want might required lots of testing and calculation. You might end up get trapped in a rabbit hole without noticing.


### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning allows you to manipulate the html elements within the webpage body. There are so many different way for you to position elements.


### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found that my head banner the easiest to implement. All I did for the html file is adding an "a tag" within the header tags. Then on the CSS side make its width to 100%, set the background-color to blue, boom, I am done.

I found that my navigation bar the hardest to implement. I was confused with the padding, margin on the CSS part. It was hard to adjust the way I intended. I spent quite amount of time in this part.


### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that if I didn't get one element's position to the place I want, I should think of another method to get that done instead of blindly trying the old way. 

I also realized that the benefits of seperating html file and CSS file. This keeps the html file purely semantic for reader to look at, While CSS handles all the styling. Obeying the rule DRY "Don't repeat yourself" for not repeating the decorative style attributes.
