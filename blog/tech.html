  <h3>What's Ruby on Rails</h3>
  <h4>Established on Jan. 30, 2016</h4>

    <p>
      Here it comes to week 8! So far we have been introduced to HTML, CSS, Ruby and Javascript in this web development camp. Especially Ruby the programming language which is best known for its use in web programming. However, Ruby itself is actually a general-purpose programming language, is there any extension or library that will make web development easier with Ruby? The answer is certainly yes. Remember the package manager that Ruby use for distributing Ruby programs and libraries, the RubyGems? And the Gem we are going to talk about is called "Ruby on Rails"!
    </p>
    <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>
    <p>
      Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. David Heinemeier Hansson is its creator. He gave it the name “Ruby on Rails,” though it is often just called “Rails.”

      It is software code that is added to the Ruby programming language. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”). That said, we have been doing "front end" stuff in this whole phase 0 period. Awesome, isn't it?
    </p>
    <h3>But why Rails?</h3>
    <p>
     Rails is popular and widely used because its conventions are pervasive and astute. Any web application has complex requirements that include basic functions such as generating HTML, processing form submissions, or accessing a database. Without a web application development framework, a programmer has a mammoth task to implement all the required infrastructure. Simply put, Rails provided a framework for developers to focus on actually building the content without worrying too much on basic files infrastructure.
