How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was great. We both got the opportunity to express our idea on wireframing and creating an HTML. We also compared the usage of div and those new html5 semantic elements and discuss the pros and cons on both side.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Definitely. Wireframing allows us to visualize our picture on the mind. It saves time on modifying during the discussion before we figure out the final wireframe version.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

For this assignment, we decided to use all the html skills that we learned on this week and apply them on this blog-template page. We think that we can always modify and decorate it later so we put the most simpliest viable version out.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned those basic html5 semantic elements such as the: header, section, article, aside, footer and nav tags.
