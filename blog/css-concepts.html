  <h3>Absolute, Relative, Fixed and Static Positioning: How do they differ?</h3><br/>

    <p>
      CSS Positioning is not hard but some of its concepts were abstract and mostly misused. After reading articles about CSS positioning, I would like to share the difference of the four positioning values of CSS positioning.  
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Static</strong>: Every single page element is positioned in <code>static</code> by default. It means the element will flow into the page as it normally would.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Relative</strong>: What it actually means is "relative to itself". If one set <code class="code-zone">position: relative;</code> but no other position attributes (top, bottom, left, right) it will show no effect on its positioning at all. It will be exactly as it would be as setting to <code class="code-zone">static</code>. One more thing should be mentioned is <code class="code-zone">Relative</code> also limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Absolute</strong>: Similar to <code class="code-zone">Relative</code>, you want to use position attributes (top, bottom, left, right) to set the location on the page. The element that positioned as <code class="code-zone">absolute</code> will be positioned relatively to its parent which was positioned relatively or absolutely. If no such parent was positioned before it, it will trace all the way back to the <code class="code-zone">< html ></code> element. Meaning it will be positioned relative to the page itself. Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the flow of the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fixed</strong>: A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will always stay at the same position.
    </p>
