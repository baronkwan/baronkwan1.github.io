  <h3>Benefits of version control and how Git & Github works?</h3><br/>

      "What the hack are version control, Git and GitHub?" I screamed. As a person who is new to the programming world these technical terms seems strange. But now I am at DBC and my objective is to get to know them! VERY WELL! Let's me try to briefly explain what are these monsters really are!
    </p>
    <p>
      So lets assume you are on a new project. And it consists of tens of hundreds of files or documents. You want to be organized. So you placed all files in one place so you know where to work on. As time goes on, you made changes here and there all over those tens of hundreds of files. Kind of a mess to keep track of changes and there may be a potential risk you have to start all over again because you made a terrible mistake. You might ask yourself, why can't real life gives you a save button at some state? Well.. here is the version control system comes to rescue your project. Version control system keeps track of users files and records all changes made over time. It allows user to jump back and forth or navigate to specific record/versions.
    </p>
    <p>
    As you can guess, Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that users install locally to handle projects with different “versions” of your work as you proceed and managed by users via adds and commits command lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about Github? Is it a version control system as well? Counterintuitively, No. Git is not Github. Github provides hosting services for users to store their projects/repositories and allowing multiple users to work collaboratively on the same project at the same time remotely by using git as its version control system. Why is it good to store your projects on Github? Because not only you can have your colleague review your code anytime and anywhere, but you can also sync with your colleague no matter what updates and merges occur. Aren't they just awesome?
